## ðŸ›  Features  
- System design is the process of creating and analyzing high-frequency electronic systems such as radar and communications devices. AWR Design Environment allows you to easily design systems using Visual System Simulator software, which supports VSWR-aware RF and DSP block modeling, and provides time-domain, frequency-domain, and conversion-domain analysis.

Electromagnetic field simulation is the process of analyzing the distribution and interaction of electromagnetic fields in high-frequency structures such as transmission lines, large planar antennas, patch arrays, and complex 3D structures. AWR Design Environment allows you to easily perform electromagnetic field simulations using AXIEM and Analyst software, which use the method of moments (MoM) and finite element method (FEM), respectively. These programs provide fast and accurate analysis of passive components on RF PCBs, modules, LTCCs, MMICs, RFICs, and antennas.

Design automation is the process of optimizing and verifying your design using various tools and features. AWR Design Environment allows you to easily automate your design process using a powerful API that extends the program's capabilities using popular programming languages. You can create custom scripts to automate common or complex tasks and customize your design flows.

Integration with other platforms is the process of making your design compatible and interoperable with other programs and technologies. AWR Design Environment allows you to easily integrate your design with other Cadence platforms, such as Allegro for PCB and system-in-package (SiP) design, Virtuoso for RFIC and module design, and advanced RF workflows. You can also export your design to other formats, such as Touchstone, SPICE, GDSII, and more.

AWR Design Environment is a comprehensive RF and microwave electronics product development platform that is suitable for all skill levels and project types.
